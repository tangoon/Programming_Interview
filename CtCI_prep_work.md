# List of prep work 

## Data Structures
* Dynamic Array
* Linked List
* Stack & Queue
* Hash Tables
* Binary Search Tree
* Binary Heaps & Priority Queue
* Graphs
* Trie

## Algorithms
* Bit Manipulation & Numbers — difference btw Unsigned vs signed numbers
* Stability in Sorting
* Mergesort
* Quicksort
* Heapsort — Sort it in-place to get O(1) space
* Binary Search
* Selections — Kth Smallest Elements (Sort, QuickSelect, Mediums of Mediums) — Implement all three ways
* Permutations
* Subsets
* BFS Graph
* DFS Graph
* Dijkstra’s Algorithm (just learn the idea — no need to implement)
* Tree Traversals — BFS, DFS (in-order, pre-order, post-order): Implement Recursive and Iterative
* External Sort — No implementation; Just know the concept.
* NP-Complete (Video) — Just know the concept
* Topological Sort
* Detect cycle in an undirected graph
* Detect a cycle in a directed graph
* Count connected components in a graph
* Find strongly connected components in a graph

## Implementation that needs to be mastered
* Implement an ArrayList from scratch
* Reverse a linked list
* Implement a Stack & a Queue using Array
* Implement a HashTable with simple Hashing functions
* Implement a Graph using Adjacency List, and then write functions for BFS & DFS.
* Write the binary search algorithm both recursively and iteratively
* Write the merge sort algorithm
* Write the quicksort algorithm
* Print binary tree using DFS (in-order, preorder and post order — all three of them) and BFS.
* Memorize time & space complexities for common algorithms. Here’s an interesting website.
* Implement a trie.
* Learn these important bit manipulation tricks.
